            <p class="text2">My name is Mariah Tritz and massage therapy is my passion!  I have done other jobs in the past but never have I looked forward to getting up each morning to help the clients that come in my door.  Now I do!  I achieved many goals while attending the Denver School of Massage Therapy including 4.0 honor roll and clinic professionalism awards.  I loved every minute of my education and was ever more excited to start my new career.
                I am very active.  Other than my massage work I also ride and train horses, love hiking Colorado, and playing with my dogs.  In my activity I have also managed to hurt myself in different ways.  This pain turned me onto massage therapy and over the years took me to the Denver School of Massage therapy to help people in similar ways to which I was helped.
                I spend a  great deal of time reading and learning all that I can about massage to stay up to date with all of the new and different techniques that are available to help my clients.  I also spend time studying the human anatomy for specific client injuries or common issues I hear people complain about on the street.  I want to be able to address each ailment that comes to me for help in the most professional manner and with as much knowledge as I can.</p>
